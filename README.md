#### Take 3
- When the user click on the `cookMeal button` the recipe card that was targeted hides and then a list of the status of each ingredinet form the user's pantry displays in the same place of the recipe card.
- After the `cookMeal` button is clicked, the user is presented with two other buttons that appear at the button of where the recipe card was. 
- The `No thanks` and `Add ingredients` button let the user decide to add the ingredients needed for the recipe to the user's pantry and the `No thanks` button let's the user go back to the previous vew to keep searching for recipes.
